Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This website describes my home in the mountains outside Albuquerque, NM.  We love animals, and have always had a few farmyard varieties around.  When we began to have grandchildren, I became "Da" and my wife became "Gram".  So, naturally, the property came to be known as "Gram's Farm".
In developing the site, I created html files for each page covered by a general stylesheet, and some separate page-specific .css files to highlight use of SASS.
